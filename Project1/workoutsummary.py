'''Objective 1: Create an interactive prompt in a function that builds out a workout plan. Your prompt should ask for the workout name,
muscle concentration (i.e. chest, shoulders, biceps, triceps, etc.), number of sets, number of reps, note/description.  Take
all the responses to build a dictionary and return results to the function call.
